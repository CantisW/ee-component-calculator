# ee-component-calculator

Simple CLI tool that can do resistor and ceramic capacitor calculations.

# USAGE

Run the script and follow the command line instructions.

Input strings **must** begin with `RST` or `CAP`, depending on whether or not you're calcuating a resistor or capacitor.

This calculator supports calculations for:

- Ceramic Capacitor Codes
- Resistor Color Band Codes (3, 4, 5, and 6)
- SMD Resistor EIA codes (EIA 3- and 4-digit, as well as EIA-96)

# BUILD

You can build this project using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/installation.html#pyinstaller-not-in-path). From there, you can add it to PATH or whatever is needed on your system to run this from CLI.

# ISSUES

Please open an issue! I'll try to be responsive (maybe...)
